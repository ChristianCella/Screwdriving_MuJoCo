# Robotic screwdriving application

## Strcucture of the project
Yet to be decided

## Utilities
- [forward_kin.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/Screwdriving_MuJoCo/blob/main/forward_kin.py): retrieves the Cartesian pose of a desired site, after applying in open loop the torques needed to cancel out gravity for a specified joint configuration of the robot;
- [impose_q.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/Screwdriving_MuJoCo/blob/main/impose_q.py): leverages the github repository [mink](https://github.com/kevinzakka/mink/tree/main), that relies on [pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) under the hood, to retrieve one of the joint configurations of the robot, based on a target Cartesian pose. This code is NOT meant for simulations involving physics: the robot is instantaneosuly configured according to the solution of the inverse kinematics, but no control is applied at the joints. (TODO: is it possible to fix the joints in some ways and read the torques?);
- [open_loop_torques.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/Screwdriving_MuJoCo/blob/main/open_loop_torques.py): This code will soon be removed. The idea was to have 2 control modes: the first one (move_robot = True) allowing to reach the target joint configuration computing in open-loop the torques at runtimne, while using a PID controller to correct small errors; the second (move_robot = True) was meant to instantly place the robot in a specific point in space, and forcing the intial configuration to be the desired one. At this point, the torques are computed to stay in that configuration, while a PD allows to correct small numewrical mistakes; 
- [test_PID](https://github.com/ChristianCella/Screwdriving_MuJoCo/blob/main/test_PID.py): this code was meant to provide an alternative to [open_loop_torques.py](), where the idea was to not compute the trques, but to read them at the joints. For this purpose, a PID was applied, with the aim of keeping adesired joint configuration. Howeveer, despite the codes does not work bad, it is not as good as [test_wrench.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/Screwdriving_MuJoCo/blob/main/test_wrench.py), that is the improved version of [open_loop_torques.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/Screwdriving_MuJoCo/blob/main/open_loop_torques.py);
- [test_wrench.py](https://github.com/ChristianCella/Screwdriving_MuJoCo/blob/main/test_wrench.py): the logic in this code is simialr to what we are going to use. Some joint configurations are specified and the inverse dynamics is computed: the wrench is specified in terms of world coordinates, therefore also the jacobian must be from world to the point (site) where the wrench is applied. Once again, a PD controller is udes to compensate for small numerical errors.
